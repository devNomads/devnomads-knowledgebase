# How to contribute [](id=contribute)

We encourage everyone to contribute to this knowledge base. 

The process should be familiar to developers:
 * create a fork on GitHub of the {dev}Nomads resources repository 
 * add valuable content or make some changes
 * send us a pull request
[More info on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-on-projects-using-issues-and-pull-requests/)

After a short evaluation your changes will be merged and become publicly available. 

## Markdown
The syntax for the knowledge base is [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/), which allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub.

The knowledge base repository will be imported on the {dev}Nomads website, which is running on Liferay, so please also check the 
[Liferay documentation for working with Markdown](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/master/guidelines/liferay-documentation-tools.markdown)
